# Choose Your Own Adventure Example Project

## Running the Project

### 1: Clone the GitHub Repository

Open a terminal in the folder you want to put your story in.

Run the following code, which will clone the GitHub repository:

```git clone git@github.com:danielstern/cyo.git```

### 2: Navigate to the `example` directory.

Go to the example directory with the following command:

```cd example```

### 3: Install NPM dependencies

CYO has no dependencies, but the example requires `express` to run. Install NPM dependencies with the following command:

```npm install```

(https://nodejs.org/en/)[If you don't have Node.js, download it here.] You need it to run the example, but not necessarily to use CYO.

### 4: Run the example

Now, start the server with

```npm start```

OR

```node server```

### 5: Open the example in your browser.

The story is now visible at the following URL:

(http://localhost:1337)[http://localhost:1337/];

            <p>
                CYO is not really a library. It's more like a new language build with interactivity in mind.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>If you're technical, getting started is simple. Just require the "CYO" module in your app and you'll have access to all the directives.</p>
<p>If the last sentence made your head hurt, just copy the follow boilerplate into an empty HTML file, and it will work out of the box.</p>
<pre><code class='markup'>&lt;doctype html&gt;
